            <h4 class="sectionTitle">Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<p><em>Last updated on 24 September 2012</em></p>
            <p><strong>Ticket Availability</strong>                        
            </p><ol>
              <li><strong style="color:#000">Why do tickets sell out so quickly for popular events?</strong> <br>
                When a popular event goes on sale there are literally hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of customers simultaneously attempting to purchase tickets across all distribution channels. Like any limited commodity, tickets are sold as long as seats are available, and sometimes they go quickly. If 500 fans are simultaneously buying four tickets each, 2,000 tickets can be sold in a matter of seconds! It's the same reason why a typical 18,000-seat arena can sell out in a few minutes. <br>
                <br>
              Also, in many cases, tickets are held by The Promoter or have been pre-sold to season-ticket holders for the entire run of the season, reducing the quantity of tickets available for purchase through TimeOutTickets.com by the general public.</li>
              <li><strong style="color:#000">Why are "better" tickets sometimes available a few minutes after the event goes on sale?</strong><br>
                When customers find tickets either online or through any of the other distribution channels, those tickets are reserved to the customer while the customer considers the purchase. During that period, which lasts for only a few minutes, no one else can view or purchase those tickets. If the customer decides not to buy the tickets, they are "released" and become available to other purchasers. </li>
              <li><strong style="color:#000">Why are "better" tickets sometimes available days after the event goes on sale?</strong> <br>
                The Promoter may release more tickets for TimeOutTickets.com to sell as the event date approaches. This happens for several reasons:<br>
                <br>
<ul>
  <li>The artist may no longer need the tickets that were held when the event originally went on sale</li>
                <li>Once the stage or event area is set up, the venue has a better idea about which seats are obstructed. Sometimes events are so popular that even seats with obstructed views are released for sale! </li>
                <li>Sometimes a customer attempts to buy tickets but their credit card is declined. If TimeOutTickets.com is unable to contact the customer to secure a valid credit card or billing address, TimeOutTickets.com may cancel the order and release the tickets for sale. Tickets may also be released if a customer does not follow TimeOutTickets.com's <a href="/tickets/terms">Terms of Use</a> or <a href="/tickets/purchasepolicy">Purchase Policy</a>.</li>
            </ul> </li>
              <li><strong style="color:#000">May I exchange my tickets if better seats become available later, or if a second show is announced?</strong><br>
                We and The Promoters regret any inconvenience, but, as with all TimeOutTickets.com ticket sales, there are no refunds, exchanges or cancellations.</li>
            </ol>

                <br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Order Confirmation Number</li>

              <li><strong style="color:#000">Can I enter the venue using the electronic confirmation of the tickets bought online? </strong><br>
                No. You need to exchange the electronic confirmation of the tickets purchased online with a physical ticket as per the rules set by The Promoter and in accordance with UAE/Dubai Regulations.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Customer Service</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong style="color:#000">Who handles refunds?</strong> <br>
                If a refund is issued by Promoter, (See <a href="/tickets/purchasepolicy#cancelled_postponed">Cancelled or Postponed Events</a>) TimeOutTickets.com will processes the refunds for the tickets it sold online or through call centers and ticket outlets. Please note that delivery fees and certain other fees associated with a ticket order will not be refunded. Please see <a href="/tickets/purchasepolicy">Purchase Policy</a> for more details. Refunds are made to the credit card used to make the purchase.</li>
              <li><strong style="color:#000">My event was canceled or rescheduled. Can I get a refund?<br>
                </strong>We're fans too, and when The Promoter cancels or postpones an event we feel your pain! However, the decision of whether or not to allow refunds is made by the Promoter not TimeOutTickets.com and we are usually contractually bound to reflect The Promoters’ refund policy. However, in most cases, the Promoter will authorize us to refund. So, if your event was canceled, in most cases you won't need to do a thing: we'll inform you of the cancellation and refund the amount you paid for your tickets (Delivery fees and other charges are non-refundable). If you bought your tickets at a retail outlet, please return them to the same location. <br>
                <br>
                If your event was rescheduled, we'll contact you with the new date and time ASAP. Can't make it? The decision to issue refunds for rescheduled events is up to The Promoter and final, but we'll do everything we can to help!</li>
              <li><strong style="color:#000">I bought tickets but I can't go to the event. Can I get a refund?<br>
              </strong>Although some Promoters let us take tickets back and issue refunds under some circumstances, unfortunately "No Refunds" is standard policy for most. We'll do everything we can to help you but we cannot guarantee that you will get your money back.<strong> </strong></li>
